          Hi [HR Name],

          I recently came across your LinkedIn post seeking a React.js developer intern, and I am writing to express my
          interest in the position at Airtel. As a recent graduate, I am eager to begin my career and am excited about
          the opportunity.

          I am a quick learner and have developed strong dynamic and user-friendly web applications using
          various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React.js, Vue.js, PHP, and MySQL. I am also
          well-versed in creating reusable components, implementing responsive designs, and ensuring cross-browser
          compatibility.

          My eagerness to learn and strong work ethic will make me an asset to your team.

          I have attached my resume for your review. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing
          from you soon.
<br>
          Thanks!
          <br> <br>
